# Eddie, the Electrician 2.0.0
A Cobalt Core mod. **Requires [Kokoro](https://github.com/Shockah/Cobalt-Core-Mods/tree/master/Kokoro)**.

Take this lazy snake for a spin and play around with **infinite cards**, **X-costs**, **hand/energy management** and **big attacks**.

![Sprite of the character, their name and frame. Description: Eddie, your ship's electrician. Their cards offer flexible ways to spend, store and gain energy.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/937b6489-74b9-45fe-8714-96a6e10ee478)


Huge thanks to **Arin** for doing the character sprite, border and card frame, and for design advice.
