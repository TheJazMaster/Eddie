# Eddie, the electrician 0.9.4
A work-in-progress Cobalt Core mod.

Take this lazy snake for a spin and play around with **infinite cards**, **X-costs**, **hand/energy management** and **big attacks**.

Huge thanks to **Arin** for doing the character sprite, border and card frame, and for design advice.

All visuals (and lack thereof) besides those are placeholders and will most likely be changed before 1.0.0
